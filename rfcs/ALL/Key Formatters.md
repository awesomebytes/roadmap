# Key Formatters
Key Formatters (KFs) are an initiative to let the user declare formats they intend to use for their Key Expressions (KEs).

Intended properties are as such:
* Let Zenoh know more about the user's KEs, allowing for more optimizations.
* Provide a convenient way for users to construct KEs and make sure they're not breaking their declared format.
* Provide a convenient way for users to extract the sections of KEs that they may have subscribed to wildly for use as parameters.

Debates on form, inner workings, and degree of functionality are still ongoing.
