# Zenoh public roadmap

:sparkle: View the [official Zenoh public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-zenoh/projects/2).

Our roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. 
Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via GitHub public feedback discussions.

The roadmap repository is for communicating Zenohâ€™s roadmap. 
Existing issues are currently read-only, and we are locking conversations, as we get started. 
Interaction limits are also in place to ensure issues originate from Zenoh team.
If you have feedback about this roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through general feedback in Zenoh public [feedback discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap/discussions).

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **roadmap stage** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. For a description of roadmap stages, [see below](#roadmap-stages). 

- A **section** that indicates the area of the project to which the item belongs. For a list of current sections, [see below](#section).

- A **genre** that indicates the type of the item. For a list of current genres, [see below](#genre).

- Once a feature is delivered, the **shipped** label will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant [Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) post.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a [project board](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-zenoh/projects/2) to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. 
Every roadmap item is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. 
Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.
