# Zenoh public roadmap

:sparkle: View the [official Zenoh public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-zenoh/projects/2).

Our roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. 
Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via [GitHub public feedback discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap/discussions).

For every release we create an [issue](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) and a dedicated GitHub project.
The issue created in this repository is a macro issue highlighting the main features and topics addressed in the release.
The dedicated project then reports all the more granular issues that need to be addressed for the release across all the Zenoh repositories.
